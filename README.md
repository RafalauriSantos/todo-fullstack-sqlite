# 🚀 To Task - Modern Fullstack Task Manager

> **From MVP to High-Fidelity SaaS**

"To Task" is a robust Task Management application that started as a simple proof-of-concept and evolved into a production-ready, secure, and visually stunning Fullstack application.

## 💡 The Evolution: Why we changed?

This project represents a journey of technical maturity. We moved beyond a simple "Todo List" to tackle real-world software challenges:

1.  **From Functional to Emotional Design:**
    *   *Before:* Standard white background, generic inputs.
    *   *After:* **"Deep Space" Glassmorphism UI**. We implemented CSS Keyframe animations (Floating Blobs), blur effects, and interactive hover states to create an engaging user experience.

2.  **From Shared to Secure (Multi-tenancy):**
    *   *Before:* All tasks were visible to everyone.
    *   *After:* **JWT Authentication & Data Isolation**. We implemented a secure backend where users can only access their own data, protected by Bcrypt password hashing.

3.  **From JavaScript to TypeScript:**
    *   *Before:* Loose typing and potential runtime errors.
    *   *After:* **Strict Type Safety**. We migrated the frontend to TypeScript to ensure code reliability and better developer experience.
